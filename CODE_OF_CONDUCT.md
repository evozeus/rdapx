# Contributor Code of Conduct

## 💡 Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of **rdapx**, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to maintaining an open, welcoming, and respectful environment for collaboration and learning.

## 🌱 Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy toward other participants  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery  
- Personal attacks or insults  
- Trolling, flaming, or harassment of any kind  
- Publishing others’ private information without consent  
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional context  

## ⚙️ Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behavior they deem inappropriate.

## 🧭 Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — GitHub, issues, pull requests, discussions, and direct communications related to the project — as well as when an individual represents the project or its community in public spaces.

## 🚨 Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at:

**maintainers@evozeus.dev**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  
The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## 🪪 Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

## ❤️ Final Note
The **rdapx** community thrives on collaboration, curiosity, and respect.  
Be kind. Be patient. Build cool things together.
